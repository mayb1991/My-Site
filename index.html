        <p class="more">I have been in the 
            automovite industry for well over 15 years. 
           <br>I went into real estate for about 3 years. I did really well
           in real estate but somthing was still missing.
           <br>I did not get the time with my family. 
           I went back to writing service for Toyota. I resently left that job after 3 years.
           <br>When Covid-19 hit in 2020 I knew it was time to strat looking 
           for a different path and time to leave automotive for good.
           <br>I have alaways been intrested how the 
           internet and comptures work,<br>
           that's when it hit me in the head, 
           technology is not going any where and it's only getting stronger.

            <br>In July of 2017 we packed up 
            and left everything we know and moved to Colorado.
            We got married in July of 2020!!!!<br>

                I am a 3rd genration real estate invester. My company 7 Seas Realty LLC 
                invest in real estate all over the United States.
                <br>I got started investing in real estate 
                when I was 21 I bought my first investment property. 
                <br>I wanted to get into web develment 
                well lets face it the internet is not going anywhere. 
                <br>Not only that but it really fanaunates me to 
                learn more about how websites work and also mechines. 
                <br>Like Tesla's and flying cars and how Space X 
                and NASA build mechines that can work from anywhere in the world
                <br>or a different plant. So none the less 
                I want to learn how to do that. I also want to use my new skill that I'm 
                going to learn to help the lessfornation.
